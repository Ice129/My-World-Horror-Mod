# Design Philosophy

## This Mods Core Vibes
this mod aims to do everything with a vanilla feel. anything done by the mod must be theoretically be possible in unmodded minecraft. this can become more of a loose rule as the mod progresses, but all actions and features need to feel as natural and player made as possible.

## Entity Behavior
the entity should feel like a real player. the entity should feel uncannily like a human player, to the point of the player questioning if it is real or not. All entity spottings should be impactful, the more used, the less impactfull it becomes. killing the player on sight or running up to them is not what a scared human would do. This entity should be designed as if it is the real human, and the player is the entity invading its world.

## Entity Lore
the entity is a human engram, they volenteered to be uploaded into minecraft once they passed on as a form f digital preservation and immortality. they were prommised a world to themselves, infinite land and time to do what they want. they died due to some sort of ilness that would have killed them soon anyway. they would have been young, thats why minecraft was chosen. they were on this world before the player joined, so seeing another human is terrifying to them, suddenly they are not alone even through they were prommised that. if that promise was broken what else was a lie? they dont know if this player is real or another engram, and they find the idea of being trapped in a world with another human terrifying, as it wil be forever. i imagine they can join maybe 1 other world, as that will allow them to have maybe a survival world (this one) and a creative one they can escape to if things get too much.

they are literaly within this world, so they have some extra controll over it, like access to the players computer and minecraft setiings, but they are not that good at it so its not a masive thing. they are still fresh to this whole digital existence thing. 

## Progression
The entity should start off being elusive and not directly seen. the player should just be guessing and asuming there is another player in their world from environmentel clues like caves already mined and other human placed blocks in their world.

at first the entity should be terrified of the player, hiding and avoiding them at all costs. if attacked they should flee and "log out". aggression towards the entity will increase the agro meter, which drives mod progression

when the entity is more used to the player being in their world, they should be more inquisitive, finding their house and exploring it and taking items from chests. the entity still wants to avoid direct confrontation however it is more brave, and will maybe punch the player off ledges or look at them from a distance.

eventually the entity should become more bold, leaving traps for the player, stalking them, maybe even comunication with signs saying they want them gone. 

never will the entity play loud noises and run at the player unprompted, unless that is the main climax of the mod. after the final kill maybe the player is put into hardcore and can no longer respawn in the world.
