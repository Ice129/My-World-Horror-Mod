# Design Philosophy

## Core Design Principles
This mod aims to maintain a vanilla feel in all aspects. Everything done by the mod must theoretically be possible in unmodded Minecraft. This can become more of a loose guideline as the mod progresses, but all actions and features need to feel as natural and player-made as possible.

## Entity Behavior
The entity should feel uncannily like a real human player, to the point where the player questions if it's real or not. All entity sightings should be impactful—the more frequently they occur, the less impactful they become. 

This entity should be designed as if **it is** the real human, and the player is the entity invading **its** world. A scared human wouldn't kill the player on sight or run directly at them.

## Entity Lore
The entity is a human engram of the mods creator, who anaged to upload their concious to this mod as a form of digital preservation and immortality. They didnt upload the file publicly so never expected to see another player. They are scared and confused on what this might mean for them as a concious if another player has access to their "brain file".

They existed in this world before the player joined. Seeing another human is terrifying to them—suddenly they are not alone, even though they were promised solitude. If that promise was broken, what else was a lie? They don't know if this player is real or another engram, and they find the idea of being trapped in a world with another human forever terrifying.

They can join one other world, allowing them to have a survival world (this one) and a creative world they can escape to if things get too overwhelming.

Because they are literally within this world, they have some extra control over it, like limited access to the player's computer and Minecraft settings. However, they're not very skilled at it—they're still fresh to this whole digital existence thing.

## Progression
*I use the term phase here, but transitions between each phase is "fuzzy", where most interactions are RNG based but impacted by the aggro meter*
**Phase 1: Elusive Presence**  
The entity starts off elusive and not directly seen. The player should be guessing and assuming there is another player in their world from environmental clues like pre-mined caves and human-placed blocks.

**Phase 2: Terrified Avoidance**  
At first, the entity is terrified of the player, hiding and avoiding them at all costs. If attacked, they flee and "log out." Aggression towards the entity increases the aggro meter, which drives mod progression.

**Phase 3: Cautious Curiosity**  
When the entity becomes more accustomed to the player, they grow more inquisitive—finding the player's house, exploring it, and taking items from chests. The entity still wants to avoid direct confrontation, but they're more brave, occasionally punching the player off ledges or watching them from a distance.

**Phase 4: Active Hostility**  
Eventually, the entity becomes more bold—leaving traps for the player, stalking them, and even communicating through signs saying they want the player gone.

**Important:** The entity will never play loud noises and run at the player unprompted, unless that is the main climax of the mod. After the final kill, the player may be put into hardcore mode and can no longer respawn in the world.
