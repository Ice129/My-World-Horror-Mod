# ENGRAM
##### (Previously My World.jar)
## A Vanilla-Style Slow-Burn Psychological Horror Mod
#### *Version 0.4.1-beta*

Horror lives in the familiar, and there is no game more familiar than Minecraft. Playing off the your own paranoia, ENGRAM is designed to make you question even the most inocous aspects of your world. 

This mod takes its time to play with you, letting you stew in your own fears all while somthing hides just out of sight, just as afraid as you are. There is a reason to all events, all building with one cohesive background narrative.

With multiplayer support recently added, this mod will leave you unable to tell where it ends, and your game begins. There are no flashy effects, no overt modded textures. Just subtle, escalating disturbances that make you question whether you did that, or someone else did.
