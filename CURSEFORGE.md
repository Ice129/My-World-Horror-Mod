# My World.jar
## A Vanilla-Style Psychological Horror Experience for Minecraft
#### *Version 0.2.0-beta — Early Access*

Horror lives in the familiar. The breaking of dirt. Torches leading the way home. A door left open. This isn't just your world anymore — it's something else.

My World.jar is a horror mod designed to seamlessly integrate into Minecraft's vanilla experience, blurring the line between what's part of the game and what's... watching you. It's meant to be installed and forgotten — until you notice something's wrong.

Built exclusively for single-player, this mod slowly erodes your sense of safety. There are no flashy UIs, no overt modded textures — just subtle, escalating disturbances that make you question whether you're truly alone.
