# ENGRAM
##### (Previously My World.jar)
## A Vanilla-Style Psychological Horror Mod for Minecraft
#### *Version 0.4.0-beta - Early Access*

Horror lives in the familiar; The breaking of dirt, torches leading the way home, a door left open. You're not the first player this world has seen.

ENGRAM is a horror mod designed to seamlessly integrate into Minecraft's vanilla experience, blurring the line between what's part of the game and what's... watching you. It's meant to be installed and forgotten until it's too obvious to ignore.

With multiplayer support recently added, this mod will leave you unable to tell where it ends, and your game begins. There are no flashy effects, no overt modded textures. Just subtle, escalating disturbances that make you question whether you did that, or someone else did.
