        direction = direction.normalize();

        // Horizontal FOV: 180 degrees (90 degrees left, 90 degrees right)
        // Vertical FOV: 120 degrees (60 degrees up, 60 degrees down)
        // This creates a simple rectangular field of view in front of the player

        // This is like drawing a line from the player pointing directly to their right
        // We rotate the viewVector 90 degrees right in the horizontal plane (flat
        // ground)
        // Correct formula: rotate view vector 90 degrees right in the horizontal plane
        // Think of it like the player extending their right arm straight out from their
        // body
        // It points perpendicular to where they're looking, on the ground level

        // ========== STEP 6: CREATE AN "UP" VECTOR (UP-DOWN AXIS) ==========
        // This is like drawing a line from the player pointing directly upward
        // We calculate it by crossing the viewVector (forward) with the rightVector
        // Cross product of two perpendicular vectors gives you the third perpendicular
        // direction
        // Think of it like: if forward is North and right is East, then up is Sky
        // This vector points perpendicular to both the view direction and the right
        // direction
        Vec3d upVector = viewVector.crossProduct(rightVector).normalize();

        // ========== STEP 7: PROJECT THE TARGET DIRECTION ONTO OUR 3 AXES ==========
        // We now have three perpendicular directions (forward, right, up)
        // We need to figure out: how much is the target direction in each of these
        // directions?
        // Dot product tells us this: how much two vectors point in the same direction
        // Higher dot product = more aligned
        // Example: viewDot close to 1 means target is nearly straight ahead
        // rightDot close to 1 means target is far to the right
        double viewDot = viewVector.dotProduct(direction); // How much is it in the forward direction?
        double rightDot = rightVector.dotProduct(direction); // How much is it in the right direction?
        double upDot = upVector.dotProduct(direction); // How much is it in the up direction?

        // ========== STEP 8: CONVERT PROJECTIONS INTO ANGLES ==========
        // atan2 is a special function that converts (x, y) into an angle
        // It gives us the signed angle from one direction to another
        // Think of it like: if you're looking forward, and something is 30° to your
        // right,
        // atan2 would give you a positive 30°. If it's 30° to the left, it gives -30°.
        // Horizontal angle: how far LEFT (-) or RIGHT (+) the target is from center
        double horizontalAngle = Math.atan2(rightDot, viewDot);

        // Vertical angle: how far DOWN (-) or UP (+) the target is from center
        double verticalAngle = Math.atan2(upDot, viewDot);

        // ========== STEP 9: FINAL CHECK - IS THE TARGET WITHIN THE FOV BOUNDS?
        // ==========
        // Check if target is within 180 degrees horizontal and 120 degrees vertical
        // hFovHalf = 90 degrees in radians (π/2)
        // vFovHalf = 60 degrees in radians (π/3)
