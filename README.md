# My World.jar
### Vanilla-style horror mod

Horror is only as scary as how immersed you are. This world is meant to be yours.

This mod aims to blur the line between base game and modded content. Ideally to be installed and forgotten about. Single player only (multiplayer support is low priority for now). 

This mod is in early access, so join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/hgCNtXbqkC) if you have any questions or want to see planned and upcoming features
