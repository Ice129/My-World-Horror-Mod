# My World.jar
## A Vanilla-Style Psychological Horror Experience for Minecraft
#### *Version 0.2.1-beta - Early Access*

Horror lives in the familiar; The breaking of dirt, torches leading the way home, a door left open. This isn't just your world anymore - it's something else.

My World.jar is a horror mod designed to seamlessly integrate into Minecraft's vanilla experience, blurring the line between what's part of the game and what's... watching you. It's meant to be installed and forgotten until it's too obvious to ignore.

Built exclusively for single-player, this mod will leave you unable to tell where it ends, and your anxieties begin. There are no flashy effects, no overt modded textures. Just subtle, escalating disturbances that make you question whether you're truly alone.
