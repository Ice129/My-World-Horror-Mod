keep produced code clean and consise. it must be readable and understandable by a human
do not introduce unneccecary complexity, keep code and logic to the simplest it needs to be.
be mindfull of code efficency, if it can be improved without adding too much complexity it should be optimised
if suggested changes could be improved to follow best pracices, do so and inform the user on why.
keep in code comments to a minimum, only add them when the code is not self explanatory.
make sure comments are as if the user wrote them, dont say things about how somthing was fixed or can be added later etc.
