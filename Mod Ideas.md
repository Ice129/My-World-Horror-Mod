# Mod Ideas
### commented out ideas are implmented

## Entity Behavior Ideas
<!-- - if Blueice129 sees the player, it has a chance to get scared, look like their mouse shook, go still nd then log out -->

- register and remember if Blueice129 is in the world at the moment or not (for entity sightings)

- be seen building small structures like a farm

- be seen mining blocks in a cave

- be seen crafting or using a furnace

- using your furnaces

- combine multiple interactions, so it can smelt ore, then mine a bit, then come back to smelt more

<!-- - punched off edge when shifting over a ledge - player looking over edge at you before running off -->

TODO:
- digging straight down, check if its 1 or 2 wide regardless, player looking down at you until you see it

TODO:
- enhanced ability to detect being looked at, especially out of corner of eye while zoomed in using a mod. will require learning how zoom mods work and how to detect if the player is zoomed in, and entity is within fov

- add armour to entity

- add held items to entity

- add items to drop on death

- resource gathering behavior (wood, stone, ores)



## Sound Ideas
- block placing and breaking sounds when underground

- seen Blueice129 nametag while somewhere, then hear them mine 3 blocks down, place a block, and they dissapear

TODO:
- footsteps when player is in a menu for over a few seconds

TEST:
- increased cave noise percent (like 100% increase, but under same circumstances)

## Block Event Ideas

<!-- - trees cut down, leaves still there - crafting table -->

- bridges over water

- pre trained horses

- pre looted structures, so villages, shipwrecks

- enemy base, if you take items or break it, becomes more aggressive 

<!-- - agro meter stored in nbt (ups destructive events) -->

- entity strip mines
  - hundreds of blocks long
  - branching
  - using jigsaw blocks
  - way out disappears when deep enough in them
    - if came down stairs/seen them up close
    - player checkpoint system for locatoon detection 

- redstone farms in biomes
  - slime farm in swamp
  - mob farm in ocean

TODO: 
- sand mined from desert 

- Looted Bonus Chest when loading into world

- by water sources, small farms are made with half grown crops

- failed speed portals on lava lakes

- entity base can be changed what type of wood is used or stone, same shape but different materials depending on resource gathered

## Item Ideas
- map ids already starting at like 5

- when opening a map, areas are pre marked out
  - these areas have random stuff
   - encampments
   - holes
   - traps
   - flowers (extra armour drain)

TODO:
- armour taking durability when near an "anomaly"

TODO:
- Compass starts to point in direction of entity base/nearest anomalous activity 

## Game Mechanic Ideas
<!-- - setting the players render distance down slowly -->

- fov decreases super slowly over 30 seconds

<!-- - increasing the players graphics settings to try and lag the player out (able to disable this in config as i can see people not wanting this if recording or with bad pcs) -->

<!-- - capping fps to 30 or lower when entity is nearby -->

<!-- - locking music to always be above 50% volume (able to disable in config, or modify the minimum volume) -->

<!-- - setting to moody brightness -->

- nights will sometimes be 20% - 100% longer occasionally

- pre leveled vilagers in villages

- 1/2 players sleeping -> 2/2 players sleeping

- ghast targeting another player other than you in nether

- mobs swap sounds eg: chicken makes cow sound

<!-- - world is set not to day 0 when spawning in, but whatever (3 (days in an hour)) * 24 * (days since 20th july 2024) * (random percent between 0.5 and 0.8(represents nights slept though)) -->

- entity takes screenshot of player when stalking them and the screenshot shows up in the screenshots folder, names somthing spooky and lore revealing
