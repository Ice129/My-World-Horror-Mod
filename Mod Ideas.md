# Mod Ideas
### commented out ideas are implmented

## Entity Behavior Ideas
- if Blueice129 sees the player, it has a chance to get scared, look like their mouse shook, go still nd then log out

- register and remember if Blueice129 is in the world at the moment or not (for entity sightings)

- be seen building small structures like a farm

- be seen mining blocks in a cave

- be seen crafting or using a furnace

- using your furnaces

- combine multiple interactions, so it can smelt ore, then mine a bit, then come back to smelt more

<!-- - punched off edge when shifting over a ledge - player looking over edge at you before running off -->

- digging straight down, check if its 1 or 2 wide regardless, player looking down at you until you see it

- enhanced ability to detect being looked at, especially out of corner of eye while zoomed in using a mod. will require learning how zoom mods work and how to detect if the player is zoomed in, and entity is within fov

## Sound Ideas
- block placing and breaking sounds when underground

- seen Blueice129 nametag while somewhere, then hear them mine 3 blocks down, place a block, and they dissapear

- footsteps when player is in a menu for over a few seconds

- increased cave noise percent (like 100% increase, but under same circumstances)

## Block Event Ideas

<!-- - trees cut down, leaves still there - crafting table -->

- bridges over water

- pre trained horses

- pre looted structures, so villages, shipwrecks

- enemy base, if you take items or break it, becomes more aggressive 

<!-- - agro meter stored in nbt (ups destructive events) -->

- entity strip mines
  - hundreds of blocks long
  - branching
  - using jigsaw blocks
  - way out disappears when deep enough in them
    - if came down stairs/seen them up close
    - player checkpoint system for locatoon detection 

- redstone farms in biomes
  - slime farm in swamp
  - mob farm in ocean

- sand mined from desert

## Item Ideas
- map ids already starting at like 5

- when opening a map, areas are pre marked out
  - these areas have random stuff
   - encampments
   - holes
   - traps
   - flowers (extra armour drain)

- armour taking durability when near an "anomaly"

- Compass starts to point in direction of entity base/nearest anomalous activity 

## Game Mechanic Ideas
- setting the players render distance down slowly

- increasing the players graphics settings to try and lag the player out (able to disable this in config as i can see people not wanting this if recording or with bad pcs)

- capping fps to 30 or lower when entity is nearby

- locking music to always be above 50% volume (able to disable in config, or modify the minimum volume)

- setting to moody brightness
